Rock paper scissors is a hand game originating from China, usually played between two people,

in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.

These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors".



A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), 

but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock");

a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper").
